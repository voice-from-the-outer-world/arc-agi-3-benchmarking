When analizing {% if use_vision %}the images{% else %}the text grids{% endif %} think about the x,y location of objects{% if use_vision %}, their colors{% endif %}, and how they relate to the game state.
{% if use_vision %}                              
The images attached here are as follows (Zero Indexed):
- 0: Final Frame before your Action
- 1-N: Frames as a result of your action.
- A Helper image showing pixels in red that changed between the Final Frame before your action and the last frame after your action.  Any changes larger than a few pixels should be considered significant.
                              
When examining the images try to identify objects or environmental patterns and their locations.
{% else %}
The text grids provided here are as follows (Zero Indexed):
- 0: Final Frame before your Action

Provide your analysis and then after providing `---` update your memory scratchpad. The memory scratchpad is a place for you to remember anything that will help you play the game better. You can structure it however you want - it's your scratchpad to use as you see fit. IMPORTANT: The memory scratchpad should be plain text. Use natural language, bullet points, or any text format you prefer. Keep the memory  scratchpad concise and within approximately {{memory_limit}} words to help manage context window size. Focus on what's most important for understanding the game environment and rules to beat the game in as few moves as possible.

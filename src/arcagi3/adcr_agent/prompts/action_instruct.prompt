AVAILABLE ACTIONS - You MUST choose from ONLY these actions:
{{available_actions_list}}

Given the frames and the provided game information above, describe
your desired action using ONLY the actions listed above.

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST use one of the actions from the list above
- Do NOT invent actions like "swipe", "drag", "tap", or any others
- If you're unsure, choose the closest matching action from the list

Provide your response in this exact format. The "human_action" field must describe
using one of the available actions from the list above (e.g., {{example_actions}}):

```json
{
    "human_action": {{json_example_action}} to reach the target,
    "reasoning": "...",
    "expected_result": "..."                             
}
```

These are multistep games, but only concern yourself with the next action.
You should favor moves/actions before trying to click on objects. Only start
clicking once you're sure movement/actions do nothing.

Only respond with the JSON, nothing else.
